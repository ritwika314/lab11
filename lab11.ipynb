    "\n",
    "- Uncover a mine, and the game ends.\n",
    "- Uncover an empty square, and you keep playing.\n",
    "- Uncover a number, and it tells you how many mines lay hidden in its surrounding squaresâ€”information you use to deduce which nearby squares are safe to click.\n",
    "- If you are not sure about a square, you can flag it. If at some point, the only covered squares are flagged, then that means you have uncovered all mine free squares and have won the game. \n",
